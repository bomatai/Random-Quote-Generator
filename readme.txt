Goal : The overall point of this project is to take an object and print it to the webpage when a button is clicked 

I have a couple of functions in here to do a couple of things 
1. Objects that store famous Quotes from Africa & Africans
2. A Function getRandomQuote randomly selects one Quote
3. printQuote() prints the randomly selected quote to the webpage
4. colorRandomizer() generates a random color in HEX 
5. pageColorChanger() changes the background each time a new object is printed to the webpage
6. clicking the "Show another quote" button on the webpage triggers all of the above 
7. autoInterval() triggers events 1-6 every 5Secs if the button isn't clicked.
